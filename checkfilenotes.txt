lsof | egrep filename

this will respond with the process still holding it
and nothing if its finished.

better than checking file size via the length command
as sometimes apps create the max size of a file initially to
help garantee successful transfer so this is not a good option

on windows write access check maybe an option but the process
would need write access would need to be granted to file
that is also not garanteed and so lsof is probably a best worst 
option for unix
